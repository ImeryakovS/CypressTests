## About my project

My project with test for Grafana. It's a public demonstration for my skills in autotests. 
I'm learning JS + Cypress currently. And my repository and code will be changed.

I will add information about setup tests and environment as soon as possible

## How to use my tests?
1) Install Grafana on local machine from https://github.com/grafana/grafana with any comfortable option
2) Start Grafana (check that this address is true http://localhost:3000/)
3) Clone this repository on your machine
4) Go to directory `CypressTests` and run in the command Line `npx cypress open`
5) Choose directory `e2e/GrafanaTests` in Cypress (default directory may delete)
6) Choose any test and run with graphic interface (or console with command `npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/GrafanaTests/*.cy.js"`)
